    <description>This mod adds a new variant for the Militor Mechanoid, equipping it with an unused weapon from the base game, the mini-slugger. The mini-slugger is a mid-range firearm that shoots a single small slug and offers moderate accuracy. Though not as powerful as the mini-shotgun, it compensates with a longer range and improved accuracy.

With this mod, every Militor Mechanoid has a 50/50 chance of being equipped with either a mini-shotgun or a mini-slugger. This change enhances combat variety, making each encounter with a Militor Mechanoid more unpredictable and engaging.

Do keep in mind that a single Militor Mechanoid with a mini-slugger may not be a significant threat in most situations. However, when they are encountered in groups or with other mechanoids, their diversity in weapons may demand more versatile defense strategies.

Additionally, players can gestate these Militor Mechanoids themselves to take advantage of their new weapon variety and add them to their ranks, thereby benefiting their own combat capabilities.

Key Features:

- Introduces the unused mini-slugger weapon from the base game
- Equips Militor Mechanoids with mini-slugger or mini-shotgun at a 50/50 rate
- Boosts combat variety
- Allows players to gestate Militor Mechanoids with mini-sluggers</description>
